# theCave
Just a game I made for my first year programming project, it's kind of fun.

So in first year we had a programming project, where we could make a windowed application using SDL2 in C, so I decided to make a fun sounding game.

The game's premise is as follows - a your child has been stolen and taken into a cave by demons, and you need to rescue them!

This was my first experiece of game design, I learned a lot about game design, using pointers in C and working with SDL2.

Note you need SDL2 to run the game.
